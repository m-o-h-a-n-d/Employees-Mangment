# Employee Management System  

🚀 A simple Employee Management System built with **JavaScript** as part of my learning journey.  
I have been working with **Laravel** for 2 years, but recently started exploring JavaScript more deeply.  
This project represents one of my first steps into the JS world.

## ✨ Features  

- **Employee Form**  
  - Add new employees with validation (name, email, phone, etc.).  
  - Prevents duplicate email or phone entries.  

- **Authentication**  
  - Simple login & logout system using **LocalStorage**.  
  - Protected routes – you cannot access the table page unless logged in.  
  - Once you log out, you cannot go back without logging in again.  

- **Employee Table**  
  - Powered by **DataTables**.  
  - Displays all employee data with pagination, search, and sorting.  
  - Export data to **CSV, Excel, PDF, or Print**.  
  - Delete employee records.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- **HTML5 / CSS3 / Bootstrap 5**  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**  
- **LocalStorage** for persistence  
- **DataTables.js** for advanced table features  
- **Bootstrap Icons** for UI enhancements

## 🔮 Future Improvements  

- Replace **LocalStorage** with a real **database** (PostgreSQL on Neon).  
- Add a backend API (Laravel or Node.js).  
- Role-based authentication (Admin / User).  
- Integrate with **React.js** for a modern frontend.
